1)Assets:
For Assets I used the create with code complete course library from unity.

2)Source : https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/create-with-		code-complete-course-library-146048

3)Code used in this project was a mixture of the code I learnt from the Create with Code series.

4)Assets changes:
Changes that were made were for vehicle assets used in the project.
The changes were size changes to make vehicles a bit smaller or bigger.
